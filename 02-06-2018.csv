I've been thinking about Oliver North.,Liberal,0,8i3vpr,self.Liberal,0,1525876850.0,"Up front, I'm mostly a liberal person. 

I often think about ways things could go south. I think about the ramifications if the 'alt-right' somehow ends up in the victor's books as the heroes who were right all along. I think about the ways this could unfold, and lately I've been thinking about Oliver North.

As many of you know, Oliver North was proven to be guilty of some heinous crimes while holding his position, but all of the charges were dropped due to heavy political pressure. One of the biggest influences being John Bolton, who is still in office and pushing agendas.

But to many, North was a good guy. He testified in front of congress, and gave information under immunity, that was later argued to be basis of gathering evidence. And the information he gave was useful. We found out about a lot of corruption, etc., while ignoring the fact that North was responsible for much of this corruption. 

It's not as if he claimed that he was commanded to break the law, and that it was actually someone higher up who coerced him into making the deals he made.

So, if the guy is to be seen as a hero, a whistleblower, that's good and all, but we never saw any convictions. Of anyone. And it was his own crimes that he made us more aware of.

So, why would the government want to protect this man?

The conservative answer, I assume, would be that just making the public aware of the corruption is a great deed, even if nobody goes down for it. He's clearly a good guy, because otherwise he would have just kept playing ball. It's understandable that his superior wouldn't take the fall, because whoever that is must be someone who really has their claws deep, and is untouchable. And the reason North got off free, is both because he didn't tread too close by throwing superiors under the bus, and because he does know more information, and threatened to make it public.

The left believes he's a war criminal and is the person who has his claws deep into the system.

If the latter is true, we should be considering why he's suddenly back in the public eye.

Given his history, he's a perfect candidate for capitalizing on what conservatives already believe about him. It would be easy for conservatives to believe that he does have more information about how corrupt our government is. Maybe now, almost 30 years later, he is willing to out people by name. 

We know corruption is bipartisan. Some of the people who spoke in support of North in 1991 were Democrats. 

What if publicly outing war crimes was not just a plea to escape trouble, or some good deed that was done, but instead all part of the plot.

Trump, who is ""not a politician"", is the other perfect character for the plot. 

If during his presidency, an unprecedented amount of information comes out about previous administrations corruption, his base and more will think, ""Wow, Trump did it after all"".

Republicans and Democrats will be the fall-guys. It will be the liberals and conservatives who already resent the two parties who will be most targeted to have faith in the ""new-era""

And most conservative will immediately identify with this group. No matter how much the loved Reagan, or Bush. 

So everyone will be laughing at liberals and how wrong they were, while the corruption lives on under yet another curtain.

We're also looking at a pretty solid blue New Mexico according to some polls I've seen.

What is different about the economy today than in 1960?,Liberal,2,856fyu,self.Liberal,3,1521347234.0,"What is different about the economy today than in 1960?

Automation, industry structure, immigration, and most of all the general progression of information technology which intersects automation but does not entirely overlap. Probably will not do anything about automation, most likely will do something about immigration, nobody is talking about Industry Structure and that is really the focus of my interest.

debt
• noun 1 a sum of money owed. 2 the
state of owing money. 3 a feeling of
gratitude for a favour or service.
-Oxford English Dictionary

If you owe the bank a hundred thousand
dollars, the bank owns you. If
you owe the bank a hundred million
dollars, you own the bank.
-American Proverb

Everything is a bubble because there is an overall lack of work to be done in the economy due to lack of consumers translating into lack of demand for goods and services; vicious cycle  et cetera.

Well, what is the culprit? Here is the actual right answer: Industry Structure / Core competency theory of the firm hollowing out the economy. Because Intellectual Property is the only profit center when you farm everything else out to the world, all other activities done by a firm are being treated as a service *outside of the firm* and this creates the bimodal distribution that is causing the economy to be so low for so long, because those activities when done outside the firm have an additional set of investors, additional set of people taking a slice, and leaving less room for a weekly paycheck for the same activity. Also, activities done outside the firm are subject to a higher level of competition than something involving an interview process, so in this additional way, the “lean” industry structure exerts downward pressure on wages. We are too efficient at doing work, and therefore a lot less effective at creating one additional job in the economy.

Some have argued that this new bimodal distribution (tale of two cities) is a more truthful representation of a meritocracy than a normal distribution, since we run up against risk/excellence pretty darn frequently, whereas bankers in the 2000s and 1990s and I guess the 1980s thought of risk in particular as being normally distributed, and therefore bad things go down very infrequently. Well, maybe if you are discriminating against the risky guys, and not giving them loans! But long tail risk is much more common than that. If you are not anticipating long tail risk, such as if you are a pension holder at United Airlines, and UA is allowed to default on 9 billion dollars in pension obligations to their employees / slaves. Then you are not only creating moral hazard, you are creating a situation where debtors are taking enormous levels of risk, because the creditor class is not actually taking any risk. Debts therefore will always need to be paid, regardless of whether it is a bad loan. Because the debtor is considered to be the one taking the risk, rather than the creditor. Sovereign nations are paying back debt at many times the principal. If you have payed 100% interest, a debt obligation should be considered met. That is not the system we have. All religions have condemnations against debtors not meeting their debt obligations, but they also all condemn usury. Even the word evokes images that are too harsh for polite company. 

For this reason, it makes zero sense for Trump to take credit for the economy. Obama bought at a low. Trump bought at high. So, there is more downside than upside to tethering the evaluation of the President's performance to the state of the economy, because these metrics also goes down on some years. We are also too close to evaluate, because we do not know what the future brings. There are bubbles everywhere in a world where growth is much lower than what we expected previously, when we were making investment decisions based on that expectation of growth/return. Indeed, the stock market is not the economy, and so the recent gains to the real economy have been modest. However, we talk about labor market tightening up without respect to the quality of those same jobs, or the sustainability of the growth, or the equity of the growth. The Fed is raising interest rates so that employers don’t lose the whip hand. The central problem has *not* been solved.

The biggest problem is industry structure; ie, the difference between GE in 1960 being the most profitable and largest employer, versus today where Apple employs only tens of thousands of people. But the scope of the conversation is limited to an infrastructure program built out with American steel. Getting that piece right doesn't preclude missing the part that bites your ass. Will it be sovereign debt? Will it be student debt? Regardless of the bubbles, the core competency theory of the firm or competition is what is hollowing out the economy. It's profitable toi a fault, and in the case of MSPs are rarely more effective than doing something in house.

The way out of the Great Recession is for firms to do more in-house, such as Elon Musk doing basically everything in-house, outside of farming out frame production to Thermo-Fusion in Newark. On the other hand, when firms instead engage something as a service, the activity in question becomes even more a cost to be minimized, rather than an asset to invest in (Human Capital). There is still an overall lack of demand for people to do work in the economy, and it is because there is an overall lack of consumers. The economy turns into a godless surveillance machine when the only buyers are oligarchs and governments. Anticipate a techlash against the firms who are not employing enough Americans, and importing Asians because they are better spatially, allowing those same firms not to do any job-training in-house while also investing in campaigns to make the price of software development labor cheaper, such as school programs training more software developers in public school with our tax dollars et cetera. That is far too lean. Google is responsible for Google’s pipeline of labour, not the US federal government. Maybe if they were a patriotic firm, caring about their interests would make sense. But they are not. The money has already crept in, and google is a bad actor that has never received any sort of public response, except from the Republicans. Is a bimodal distribution inherently prone to class warfare? It certainly seems the case. Attacking the big four tech companies would be the most meaningful step toward fixing our spirit, because we are only as good as our citizens. We need to hurt the people that have been hurting us. Most of all, because they are a powerful symbol of what the economy has become, and somehow, everyone and their dog understands that the automation, industry structure, immigration, and most of all the general progression of information technology that allows us as a group of skilled workers to do more work for less money. There is nothing to be done about automation or technology, but immigration and industry structure are the sorts of contours of the market the the feds are able to shape.

Results of asking about opposing political views,Liberal,18,851ime,self.Liberal,5,1521289657.0,"In hopes of learning more about other views (and maybe even fostering a bit of dialogue) I recently asked a few political subreddits if they had any common ground with particular opposing political groups.  The question looked something like this:

> This is an X board, so Y is probably very far away from most of your political viewpoints.  But as far off as Y is, their position is still one that many thinking people support.  Where do you find yourself agreeing with Y, or at least sympathizing with their thinking?

I asked:

* [r/progressive about Republicans](https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/839l4w/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_republicans/)
* [r/conservative about liberals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/8311iq/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_liberals/)

* [r/libertarian about communists](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/8308tl/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_communism/)

Many people responded, and many of them did have some common ground with their political rivals, though they generally thought their rivals took things too far.  Based on the responses I got, here's some of what I learned:

-----

**Liberals** agreed with conservatives in many areas.  A number of people made and upvoted comments showing:

* disdain for the concept of safe spaces, cultural appropriation, and college ""SJW stuff""
* that biology plays a sizable role in ""gender and racial differences""
* a pro-life position
* opposition to investing in social programs that misuse resources
* support for freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, due process
* support for an energy policy using coal/oil/gas

> I generally find SJWs and their ilk just as far away from being liberal as people that are more customarily called conservatives.

> I agree with conservatives on certain economic issues...

-----

**Progressives** had some common ground with Republicans on the right to bear arms and the idea that excessive taxes can be harmful.

> I think Republicans are not completely wrong in many cases, but that their positions are exaggerated or extreme.

-----

**Donald Trump supporters** had many things to say about Democrats, but almost all of it found no common ground.  One person mentioned that they agreed with Democrats on marijuana legalization.

> ...I am finding it harder and harder to find common ground, as they keep going farther off the deep end...

-----

**Communists** mostly found no common ground with libertarians.  Some found common positions in:

* opposing US military interventions
* opposing the two-party system
* favoring LGBT rights

Then they banned me from r/communism without explanation.

> ...I can see how libertarians can develop leftist politics but as it stands their lack of understanding of economics prevents that.

-----

**Libertarians** found many areas of agreement with communists.

* opposing US military interventions
* the right to bear arms
* aiming for a stateless society
* strong workers' rights
* opposition to fascism

> I agree with their ideal...but I recognize that [it] will never happen and that every attempt at bringing it about has resulted in tyranny.

-----

**Republicans** and **Democrats** did not respond at all.

**Conservatives** did not get a chance to respond, as their moderators removed the post.",2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

What is the argument against Lauren Southern?,Conservative,14,8mphwa,self.Conservative,34,1527537074.0,"Given my own political views, I thought this might be the best place for my question.

What is the problem people have with Lauren Southern? Unlike a few people on the alt-right, I've not actually heard her say anything too ridiculous, but she seems to be grouped in with Spencer. She's been on LouderWithCrowder and Rubin Report (a while back), so I have assumed that she's not too extreme (Rubin isn't a great standard for that, I know). 

I'm currently watching her YouTube video on Tommy Robinson's arrest, which seems like an issue that the US-based media should take a stand on regardless of politics. I suppose the secondary question is whether I've missed something in that reporting, but as far as I can tell, he's been arrested for livestreaming a court case, which would have been considered a right of Englishman when the U.S. was founded.",2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

Letter To Grandpa,Conservative,18,8mo46a,self.Conservative,2,1527518934.0,"Dear Grandpa,

In 1999, I found out your son died, so I flew back home to Chicago. It took me a couple of days to find him, he was buried by Catholic charities. He now has a headstone.

In my quest to find dad, I found your wife. I was 10 when I last saw her, before she came to be back in your arm’s embrace in 1993.

I laid flowers on grandma’s grave and placed a Russian and Polish flag on her grave as she was always fond of saying the Polish language was lower Russian. As I remembered her from times in my youth, she always made sure I ate, often telling me to “zaparkuj swój tyłek i zjedz!” (Park your butt and eat). 

I looked to the left of her grave and for the first time in my life I found you. In reading your headstone, I learned you served the country I was born in, you fought in World War II for the United States Army and were lucky enough to make it home and become a veteran. Unfortunately you passed away 3 years before I was born.

As I look back on this day of memorial, I am reminded of your service to this country. Not only did you leave your homeland, you immigrated to this one and fought for it, you made it possible for me to be born and live in a country with the freedoms you only had for a very short period in your life.

As I met you that day, you taught me a profound lesson that I will never forget. Defending people’s freedom comes from an act of unconditional love toward people you don’t know.

Today, the world is not as you left it. People exercise those freedoms, that you and your fellow service men safeguarded, in ways to destroy that which you fought for - they’ve lost touch of what those freedoms mean and how one must fight to preserve them for future generations.

As I sit here today thinking of you and your grandson (named after you), that served this country, I am yet humbled by another lesson. The sacrifice one makes to defend freedom isn’t for glory, martyrdom, or money, it’s a legacy one leaves to forever remind others that there is never too steep a price to pay for the freedoms we have.



Keep the legacies alive this Memorial Day - talk about those that served this country and that have left us, and be thankful for their unselfish sacrifice.",2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

"Do you guys feel its unfair that White Nationalists/Fascists are considered 'Far Right', despite the fact that small government conservatism has nothing to do with such ideas?",Conservative,381,8mbwkc,self.Conservative,116,1527386766.0,"When people say Far Left, they mean the Antifa types, Socialists or outright communists. Though most (sane) liberals would disagree with the positions of such individuals, these ideas are still inherently extreme versions of the liberal ideology (high taxes, forced asset sharing, socialized services, big government etc). 

However, when people say far right, the image that springs to mind are White nationalists, the Alt-right or Nazis. These ideas have nothing to do with being pro small government, which is the basis of the modern conservative movement. Conservatism values freedom, small governemnt, free market economics, capitalism etc. A true 'far right' activist would be liberterian or even anarcho capitalist. Though most conservatives are not Liberterians and see the benefit of atleast some level of governemnt, these positions are the true extreme representation of a right wing ideology. Not White supremacy or white nationalism.

In fact, these so called ""far right"" individuals often campaign for disgusting and massive government programmes to deport people of colour, and often seek help from the state to enforce their extremist ideologies. How are such ideas far right? 

I'm a UK conservative, so despite me being almost certainly more liberal than most people here, I am still a capitalist and want the governemt to stay out of my life. I'm right wing by UK/european standards. But I hate it when I speak out against anti white bigotry and affirmative action I'm called far right, which has white nationalist implications now. No, I'm not a white nationlist. I'm not even white ffs. I'm as much pro white as I am pro black or pro pakistani. I'm pro equality and pro individualism. But then since these extremists ideologies are associated with conservatives now, it gives people a chance to just dismiss me as a far right nut and not engage with me.

When people think Far Left looneys, they think a well intentioned but misguided bufoon. When people think Far right they think racist. The left obviously doesn't want to include these people under the umberella of the left, but for some odd reason even these people have started self identifying with the right, and this has greatly tarnished the rights reputation.

Dennis Miller comments on Bob Woodward,Conservative,6,8mbbsi,self.Conservative,4,1527381629.0,Was listening to Dennis Miller's podcast today.  He made a fascinating point about Bob Woodward and the Trump witch hunt.  For those who don't remember Woodward was the driving factor in the press that kept the crimes of the Nixon administration in the news.  Eventually at least one person who really understood what happened gave info to Woodward and his subsequent reporting resulted in the Senate investigation and Nixon's resignation.  Miller said wouldn't it be something if Woodward actually investigated the crimes of the hillary campaign and the obama regime and their illegal efforts to screw Trump.  The point being that Woodward is a darling of the left because of his part in the take down of Nixon.  And of course how the hypocritical liberals would condemn him if he actually got the real story from a source as to how the whole plot of crimes against Trump unfolded.  ,2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

I'm thinking hard about how reddit' s algorithm works, does it track which post I look at and try to recommend things I would engage with on the front page?

My mind goes towards the idea that it isn't just me, but Reddit is plainly pushing an Anti-American, Anti-Gun agenda. If that's the case, should I consider leaving this platform?

I think that Trump has responded correctly to these attacks.  If I were in his shoes, I would have used all of the powers at my disposal to attack in response. 

Many of attacks have also come from Republicans, like Flake, McCain, Kasish and others.  While the left wing attacks are vicious and lacking in all intelligence, the Republican attacks smack of jealousy and sedition.   ",2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

Megathread: F.B.I. Raids Office of Trump’s Longtime Lawyer Michael Cohen,politics,56358,8b1jtj,self.politics,24874,1523333394.0,"[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/fbi-raids-office-of-trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen.html)

>[The F.B.I. on Monday raided the office of President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, seizing records related to several topics including payments to a pornographic-film actress.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/fbi-raids-office-of-trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen.html)

>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan obtained the search warrant after receiving a referral from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, who called the search “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.” The search does not appear to be directly related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation, but likely resulted from information he had uncovered and gave to prosecutors in New York.

The charges against Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Mr. Gates, a business associate of Mr. Manafort, include conspiracy against the U.S., multiple counts of money laundering, failure to report financial information, and providing false or misleading statements to financial bookkeepers. These indictments represent a significant escalation in a special counsel investigation that has cast a shadow over the president’s first year in office.

"Megathread: Supreme Court rejects administration appeal, must continue accepting renewal applications for DACA program",politics,33738,80dp2r,self.politics,2713,1519686845.0,">[WASHINGTON (AP) ](https://apnews.com/531f2f5dc4844ac082f356d53ddcc32a/Supreme-Court-rejects-administration-appeal-over-immigration) — The Supreme Court is rejecting the Trump administration’s highly unusual bid to get the justices to intervene in the controversy over protections for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants.

>The justices on Monday refused to take up the administration’s appeal of a lower court order that requires the administration to continue accepting renewal applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. What made the appeal unusual is that the administration sought to bypass the federal appeals court in San Francisco and go directly to the Supreme Court.

"Even amongst prison inmates, pedophilia is perceived to be the most disgusting of crimes. Yet Roy Moore is still supported by the GOP",Liberal,416,7htaqc,self.Liberal,132,1512540978.0,"It's commonly known by those who are familiar with the prison system that people who have committed sex crimes against children are the inmates who have the most difficult time. Ostracized, often faced with physical abuse from inmates who view their actions as heinous and detestable, many eventually commit suicide in prison. [(source)](http://abcnews.go.com/US/prison-living-hell-pedophiles/story?id=90004)

Cue Roy Moore. Not only have many 'Alabamians' doubled-down on Moore over a Democratic candidate, but the RNC has actually reversed their initial rejection of the accused candidate, and continue to fund his campaign. While I support due process in a court of law, enough substantial evidence has been provided to reasonably question Moore's fitness for public office. If I were a Republican official (especially in the current climate of sexual harassment of the past couple months), I'd want to distance my party as far as possible from the highly plausible accusations against Moore. This Faustian deal of endorsing Moore to maintain the GOP majority and pass their haphazardly constructed legislation further proves to me that even society's worst, America's criminals, will condemn a pedophile before a ""scrupulous"" Republican if votes are at stake. Sexual behavior with an adolescent or younger is predatory, wrong, and illegal, whether your name is Milo Yiannopoulos, Kevin Spacey, or Judge Roy Moore. If so many Republicans have the guile to say homosexuality is immoral, but won't stand against the sexual misconduct of their peers, then when will the GOP stop being identified as the party of moral, Christian, family values?



**TL;DR**- Why is the GOP the party of moral fiber if even the people we've deemed as dangers to society have a harsher view on pedophilia than Republicans?",2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

Confirming he lives in Tennessee and is almost finished with his doctorate: https://i.imgur.com/gXkiLKu.jpg

2) CNN didn't blackmail anyone. They did him a favor by not releasing his name. The First Amendment protects you from the government. It doesn't stop others from using their free speech to criticize your bigotry.

Racists will cry about free speech because they know their views are not accepted in public. It's not doxxing when CNN reports your name. It's journalism.

The news reports people's names all the time. Being anonymous on 4chan and reddit doesn't give you a right to remain anonymous if you're careless with your personal information and you do something newsworthy.

3) CNN also didn't doxx anyone. Again, they did him a favor by not releasing his information. CNN was perfectly within their rights and ethics to investigate this guy because he was part of a nationally-relevant news story.

The president re-tweeting something you said makes you into a person of public interest whether you like it or not, whether you posted it semi-anonymously or not.

4) He said FAR WORSE things than the GIF:

> June 2017: HanAssholeSolo posted an image of CNN journalists and employees with a Star of David next to them writing, “Something strange about CNN...can't quite put my finger on it...” [above]

> “FBI stats don’t lie n-----. You hood rats account for more that 50% of the murder, rape, robbery, and assault in the USA.”

> “I just like dancing when n------ are getting beat down by the cops.”

Is the Muslim ban simply a cover? Pay very close attention over the next several days...,Liberal,275,5r10ir,self.Liberal,85,1485815092.0,"""I don't like to talk about politics on Facebook-- political history is my job, after all, and you are my friends-- but there is an important non-partisan point to make today. 

What Bannon is doing, most dramatically with last night's ban on immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries-- is creating what is known as a ""shock event."" Such an event is unexpected and confusing and throws a society into chaos. People scramble to react to the event, usually along some fault line that those responsible for the event can widen by claiming that they alone know how to restore order. When opponents speak out, the authors of the shock event call them enemies. As society reels and tempers run high, those responsible for the shock event perform a sleight of hand to achieve their real goal, a goal they know to be hugely unpopular, but from which everyone has been distracted as they fight over the initial event. There is no longer concerted opposition to the real goal; opposition divides along the partisan lines established by the shock event.

Last night's Executive Order has all the hallmarks of a shock event. It was not reviewed by any governmental agencies or lawyers before it was released, and counterterrorism experts insist they did not ask for it. People charged with enforcing it got no instructions about how to do so. Courts immediately have declared parts of it unconstitutional, but border police in some airports are refusing to stop enforcing it. 

Predictably, chaos has followed and tempers are hot.

My point today is this: unless you are the person setting it up, it is in no one's interest to play the shock event game. It is designed explicitly to divide people who might otherwise come together so they cannot stand against something its authors think they won't like. I don't know what Bannon is up to-- although I have some guesses-- but because I know Bannon's ideas well, I am positive that there is not a single person whom I consider a friend on either side of the aisle-- and my friends range pretty widely-- who will benefit from whatever it is. If the shock event strategy works, though, many of you will blame each other, rather than Bannon, for the fallout. And the country will have been tricked into accepting their real goal. 

But because shock events destabilize a society, they can also be used positively. We do not have to respond along old fault lines. We could just as easily reorganize into a different pattern that threatens the people who sparked the event. A successful shock event depends on speed and chaos because it requires knee-jerk reactions so that people divide along established lines. This, for example, is how Confederate leaders railroaded the initial southern states out of the Union. If people realize they are being played, though, they can reach across old lines and reorganize to challenge the leaders who are pulling the strings. This was Lincoln's strategy when he joined together Whigs, Democrats, Free-Soilers, anti-Nebraska voters, and nativists into the new Republican Party to stand against the Slave Power. Five years before, such a coalition would have been unimaginable. Members of those groups agreed on very little other than that they wanted all Americans to have equal economic opportunity. Once they began to work together to promote a fair economic system, though, they found much common ground. They ended up rededicating the nation to a ""government of the people, by the people, and for the people."" 

Confederate leaders and Lincoln both knew about the political potential of a shock event. As we are in the midst of one, it seems worth noting that Lincoln seemed to have the better idea about how to use it.""


The post is not mine. It originated from a person named Heather Richardson (apparently she's on the top search result for shock event). And I would appreciate it if it were shared to other left leaning forums so we can maintain focus (I would love to, but the ten minute rule). Thanks.

Trump's firing of U.S. Attorney might be related to Mr. Bharara becoming a nightmare for all the insider traders in the Wall Street including many of Trump's friends and associates in New York.,Liberal,248,5yybbp,self.Liberal,31,1489347730.0,"Yes, by firing of Preet Bharara Trump has shown that he doesn't want to clean the swamp in Washington or elsewhere in the country, especially in New York where Trump grew up and where most of Trump's shady businesses are located.

Otherwise why Trump would kick out a very respected and well known U.S. Attorney like Mr. Bharara whom he promised to keep once he took total control of this country.

The question that comes to everybody's mind is maybe Mr. Bharara was too close to finding some shady deals that Trump was engaged in.

Maybe all of Trump's ruse that he was against Wall Street was nothing but to distract all of his followers from the fact that he himself had made heavy involvements with the sharks of Wall Street.

And given his very close relationship with the winners of Wall Street like Mr. Carl Icahn and Mr. Barack, Trump might've used a very significant amount of his own money through a very heavy investments in the range of billions of dollars in the stock market. 

Probably most of the venture capitalists whom Mr. Bharara was trying to put behind bars are frequent visitors to the Trump Tower exchanging pleasantries as well as sheer cash.

So it might've become quite obvious to Mr. Trump that this man Mr. Preet Bharara whom he promised to keep in his position as a Wall Street enforcer, is now becoming a pain in Trump's butt.

By going after the same people in the Wall Street, Mr. Bharara very inadvertently might've come across some big names in the hedge fund industry who were using insider trading as a way to make billions of dollars for billionaires like Trump and his partners in crime.",2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

Trump the rich guy and his very rich Republican party can only think about giving a tax break to their rich buddies under Trumpcare rather than taking care of these 24 million Americans whose healthcare will be gutted as per the latest C.B.O. report.,Liberal,237,5zbjc5,self.Liberal,37,1489519243.0,"Yes, if only a multi billionaire Trump and his billionaire buddies in the Republican party, whose coffer was filled up thanks to the huge amount of money that their very rich donors are pouring in, could think in a sensible way what their Trumpcare plan are going to do 24 million American citizens like us and also the legal residents of this great country, they'd have abandoned their very ill conceived and very malicious plan which is going to kill more people here from lack of a basic healthcare that what a small time famine can do in an impoverished country in Africa.

Actually Trump and the Republicans are still in denial that they've been left standing on their broken legs since this very shocking and a very damning C.B.O. report came out 2 days back saying very correctly that at least 24 million of our people will lose their only lifeline that Obamacare provided to them in 2010 through the Democratic healthcare bill which covered more number of Americans that anyone could dream then.

But Trump and the Republicans started denigrating this latest report long before it came out.

They didn't care that this report was compiled by the same bipartisan government agency as before. Nothing's changed.

And it's quite an irony to hear Trump complain about this report whereas he always used C.B.O. reports to cuss Obama""on economic growth,tax cuts,employment and other issues"" as mentioned in a NYT column.

But now the same Trump, who'd always shown a tendency to accept news that was favorable to him and rejected the results that pointed out his faults, is once again trying to prove to his ignorant followers that this report was biased from the very beginning.

He has no intention to tell them the truth that C.B.O. office has equal number of Democrats and Republicans in it.

Yes Trump is the same man, who denounced the job numbers when it said the number of jobless Americans are much lower since Obama came in, blaming the report on Obama's henchmen, is now touting the higher number of American employed in February as if it happened because of him.

For Trump the lower unemployment numbers could never happen if he didn't win the presidential election.

He also takes credit for higher growth and the rise in stock market telling his under educated followers that Dow Jones Industrial marker was going down when Obama was president but shot up since he came into power. 

And that is nothing but bull since DJI markers long passed 19,000 points under Obama.",2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

So here's my story.  I am trying to get into the dating world a year after losing my wife.  I get on Match.com, and as you might imagine, virtually every woman lists her political leanings as conservative.

Last night I started getting messages from a woman I hadn't noticed yet.  Part of what she liked about me was my political views.

She was married for 24 years.  She loved being married, and her husband was a good guy.  He didn't give a damn about politics.

Then we elected a black president, and he lost his shit.  Suddenly politics are all he thinks about.  He started stockpiling provisions for the coming apocalypse.  He couldn't understand how his wife didn't see that the world was coming to an end.  It took a toll on their marriage, and they divorced a few years ago.

See what this shit does to people?  ",2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

Never mind the fact that Obama began his presidency almost exactly 65 years after the end of WWII.
Never mind the fact that college enrollment hit record highs under the Obama presidency.
Never mind the endless string of fact checks pointing out these nuances and others showing why that number is where it is.
The criticism was based on the number alone, and mitigating factors were discussed rarely, if ever.
I'd say it's time to start talking about this statistic, if only to point out that there's more to labor force participation than just this number.

From what I understand it will cost $60 billion over 10 years, so $6 billion a year with the federal government absorbing 75% of that cost, and states picking up the remaining 25%.  This would lead to a better paid workforce, which in the long run would lead to more tax revenue, without necessarily having to raise taxes.  My only request would be that the president find the funding without having to raise taxes, i.e. ""pay as you go"".

They didn't need 60 votes. They needed 51. You can pass any budget vote through reconciliation, and you only need 51 votes--a simple majority. But you only get to use budget reconciliation once per year. Republicans decided to pass their tax bill through reconciliation instead of a budget. They decided to pass a bill that by design took away people's insurance and gave the richest Americans and corporations huge tax cuts. That was their choice. They could have worked with Democrats back then, gotten 60 votes and not needed them now. But again, they made a choice. Now the GOP needs Dems and after 10 years of obstructionism and an unwillingness to work with them, all they have to fall back on is what they're comfortable with--blaming Democrats.

TIL that I am not a Libertarian,Liberal,140,10oglu,self.Liberal,107,1348976546.0,"I have been struggling for a while trying to determine which political philosophy best describes my personal philosophy.

I started with conservativism because I was raised fairly conservative and am a Christian. I decided to determine where they stand on several key issues. The way I see the current conservative views are as follows: (foriegn affairs) interventionalist, (economic policy) Raegan style top-down economics, (social) racist/sexist/homhobic--and using the Bible to support these views. Well, that didn't cut it for me.

So I went on to look at Libertarians, they support gay rights and are non-interventionalist, right? Well, I was finally able to wrap my mind around the ideas of Libertarianism and they kind of scared the shit out of me. Did you know that they support a system of governance whereby the free-market controls EVERYTHING? Basically, many libertarians are anti-tax, anti-regulation, and believe that the free market and enterprise will be able to effectively regulate itself. Taxes used to build infrastructure are wrong (nay, theft!), taxes used to educate the populace are THEFT!, and taxes used for really anything that government does are theft. This is completely insane.

TL;DR: I now realize that I am a ""crazy Liberal"" because I believe top-down economics doesn't work, because I believe people should have freedom over their bodies, and because I believe that some level of government spending and regulation (schools, infrastructure, etc.) are absolutely necessary to the functioning of a modern economy.

"Liberal here, want to apologize for my side",Conservative,3536,5ceoir,self.Conservative,631,1478902596.0,"EDIT: OK, the title was incorrect
I called myself a liberal. That is true, but I guess I should correct that to ""somewhat left of centre, but not very far out"". I guess I should just stick with ""these are my ideas. I have agreed with the Liberal party of Canada for most of my life, hence I call myself a liberal"". 

  I made this post because, as much as I disagree with the conservative ideology, I don't hate conservative people. And I want to show that the perception that no liberal can maintain a civilized ideological disagreement while not bashing the people who disagree with them is wrong. I do not mean to force my views on you.

1) I want to apologize for the SJWs. I disagree with their ideology entirely, and hope to keep it out of the Canadian government.

2) I do still disagree with many conservative points, but I don't hate conservatives as people. So this post doesn't mean that I am now a conservative - rather, it means that I am disillusioned with what ""liberal"" means today.

3) I hope that, even though we disagree on many topics, we can come together as a common people.

 I will not lie - I had initially hoped for a Hillary presidency. As time went on, however, I decided that I liked neither candidate. But I am going to wait and see what Trump does, instead of immediately denouncing him.

What I am for
---------------
1) Equal rights for all, regardless of skin colour, race, religion, etc.

2) Freedom of speech. Even speech which I don't like.

3) Peaceful protest.

4) Freedom of religion. But subject to restrictions to maintain human rights. Eg. I don't care if you choose to wear a cross or a bindi or a yamuka or etc. out of choice, because of your religion. But I don't think that any religion's values should be forced on nonbelievers.

What I am against
--------------------
1) Division into groups. Everyone should have equal rights. And while I think everyone should be able to be proud of their heritage, I think that, as with many other things, there is an acceptable limit. I.e., you shouldn't go around saying you are better than everyone else because of your heritage.

2) Separation and echo chambers. I have to admit, I was guilty of this. I am now trying to make amends. I think that this has happened on both sides. 

3) Forcing your views on others.

I don't know what ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" will mean in the future. I just want to apologize for SJWs and say that, even though we may disagree ideologically, I hope that we can work together in the future.

I understand that you will disagree with some, or even all, of what I said. I think that's fine. Disagreement is healthy for discourse, and as long as it remains civil, I have no problem with it.

I apologize if this comes across as posting in a sub where I shouldn't post. But I wanted to step out of the echo chamber.

EDIT: Some rebuttals: 

1) No, I am not and never will be a conservative. I don't mind conservative people, but I am not a conservative. I am for a fully secular government, I want more liberal economic policies such as stimulus packages, etc. 

2) I do not mean to say that I disagree with all of the left. I was concerned that the protestors would make me look bad. I simply wanted to point out that I do not condone violence. Peaceful protest is perfectly acceptable. 

3) As my friends have pointed out to me, the electoral college exists for a reason. While I am sad that Hillary lost (although TBH, even though I preferred her to Trump, I was beginning to be unsure), I don't want to get involved in contesting a presidential victory. 

4) I do not want a fully liberal or a fully conservative government. I want a coalition or a centrist government, to prevent extremists on either side from setting policy. 

5) I acknowledge that by listening to only a few news sources, I was not being open minded. But I think that people on both sides were doing this. 

6) I support choice. I want people to have the freedom to do whatever they want, with reasonable limits. You and I disagree on the definiton of ""reasonable"", as shown by some comments below. This includes abortion. Disagreement is fine, but I strongly value this. 

7) As others have pointed out, I cannot claim to speak for all liberals. That was a mistake.

So no, I am not, and will never will be a conservative. I know that many of you will disagree with this, which as I said earlier, is perfectly fine. That was the main point of this post, one that got lost among my inept writing. ",2018-06-02 11:47:58.602123+00:00

And it is probably the most frustrating thing, lol.

My entire family is Democrat and anti-Trump. Their social media pages are full of posts about racism, are the police are evil, etc. I’ve put so many of them on a block and some will tag me in their stuff. And it’s usually some bs post that can be fact checked, which they refuse to do. 

My boyfriend could careless about politics and when we talk about it, he pretty much has no opinion it. So conversing with him can be underwhelming. Especially, something I’m passionate about.

Most of my friends (Black and White) are liberal. They steer away from political talk with me because they know how I feel about things.

I just wish there were more open people of color that held the same beliefs, that I could talk to without feeling like I’m weird or something.
