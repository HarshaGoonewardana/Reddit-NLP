**Just a reminder, all comment and civility guidelines still apply**

There have been approximately 187 major news stories* since the last WH Presser, just over a week ago. Aside from major questions around the current situation with North Korea, it’s anyone’s guess as to what will be discussed. 

1. Nearly a week ago Trump announced that he was calling off the scheduled June 12th Summit Talks with DPRK leader Kim Jung Un, citing threatening and disparaging remarks from various leaders in the DPRK as reasons. The move seemed to take many by surprise, including key players from both North and South Korea. It now seems as if plans are back in motion for the Summit, although nothing has been confirmed, to date. Kim Yong-Cho, the former ‘top spy’ for the DPRK, is in New York and expected to meet with SOS Pompeo, presumably in an effort to revive the Summit. 

As usual, there is plenty more going on. Feel free to add, below

Cohen, seizing records related to several topics including payments to a pornographic-film actress.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/fbi-raids-office-of-trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen.html)

>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan obtained the search warrant after receiving a referral from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, who called the search “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.” The search does not appear to be directly related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation, but likely resulted from information he had uncovered and gave to prosecutors in New York.

"Paul Manafort and his former business associate Rick Gates were told to surrender to federal authorities Monday morning, the first charges in a special counsel investigation, according to a person involved in the case.

The charges against Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Mr. Gates, a business associate of Mr. Manafort, include conspiracy against the U.S., multiple counts of money laundering, failure to report financial information, and providing false or misleading statements to financial bookkeepers. These indictments represent a significant escalation in a special counsel investigation that has cast a shadow over the president’s first year in office.

"James Comey has sent a letter to congress updating and clarifying his letter from the 28th.

>“Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,” Comey wrote on Sunday. “During that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State … I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.”

>“Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,”

">[WASHINGTON (AP) ](https://apnews.com/531f2f5dc4844ac082f356d53ddcc32a/Supreme-Court-rejects-administration-appeal-over-immigration) — The Supreme Court is rejecting the Trump administration’s highly unusual bid to get the justices to intervene in the controversy over protections for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants.

>The justices on Monday refused to take up the administration’s appeal of a lower court order that requires the administration to continue accepting renewal applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. What made the appeal unusual is that the administration sought to bypass the federal appeals court in San Francisco and go directly to the Supreme Court.

"**Update: Steve Goldstein, top spokesman for fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, himself was fired Tuesday for contradicting the official Trump administration account of Tillerson's dismissal.**


President Trump asked Rex Tillerson to step aside as Secretary of State and is replacing him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

Trump also tweeted:

> Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!

"Andrew G. McCabe has stepped down as the F.B.I.’s deputy director, a move that was widely expected as he has repeatedly come under fire from Republicans in Congress and from President Trump.

An American official said Mr. McCabe made his intentions known on Monday. He will immediately go on leave and plans to retire when he becomes eligible in mid-March.
